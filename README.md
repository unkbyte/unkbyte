### :bust_in_silhouette: About me
I am a retired game hack developer with over 5 years of experience in the field. During my time in the industry, I was able to bypass various anti-cheat systems such as EAC, BE, and Vanguard.

In addition to my experience in game hacking, I have also been developing software for the past 8 years. I consider myself a low level developer and have a passion for reverse engineering.

Currently, I am working on creating my own programming language named Cyon [@cyon-lang](https://github.com/cyon-lang/).
